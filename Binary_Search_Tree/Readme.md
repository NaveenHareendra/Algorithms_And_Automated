# CLRS Answer #Challenge
<li>
 <ol> This algorithm is an In-order tree walk procedure that is designed by me as an iterative method, using the sophisticated method using two pointers..</ol>
 <ol> I have also showed some possible design for iterative in order tree walk using "stacks".. which is quiet not bad too..
higher memory (stack method)> two pointer method</ol>
</li>
 
This will run at O(m) average, don't consider to be the most efficient iterative method also, can be improved for sure as well.

At the end of the day best method best method:rescursive - O(n) time
procedure (node)
  if node!=null
      procedure(node.left)
      print
      procedure(node.right)
